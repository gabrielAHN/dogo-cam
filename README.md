# Dogo Cam

Manual Raspberry Pi dog camera: Flask web UI, live Picamera2 stream, pan/tilt MG90S servos (keyboard, on‑screen arrows, mobile touch‑drag), temperature/humidity readout (local DHT22 or Home Assistant), and optional Cloudflare Tunnel. Manual‑only (tracking removed).

## Layout

- `dogcam_stream.py` — Flask app + camera endpoints
- `servo_control_rpigpio.py` — MG90S pan/tilt control
- `ky004-control.py` — optional GPIO on/off switch
- `templates/` — camera UI + login
- `service_startup/` — example systemd units
- `deploy/` — CI deploy script + scoped sudoers
- `PIN_DIAGRAM.md` — full wiring reference

## Hardware

Raspberry Pi 3B (Pi OS) + **wide-angle NoIR CSI camera (OV5647 sensor, no IR-cut filter)** + 2× MG90S servos, plus optional GPIO toggle switch, DHT22 (`GPIO4`), and cooling fan.

| Part | Signal / V+ / GND pins | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| NoIR wide-angle camera | ribbon → CSI port | OV5647 sensor; sees in the dark under IR, wide FoV. Dedicated camera port, not GPIO |
| Tilt servo (servo1) | `GPIO18` (Pin 12) / Pin 2 (5V) / Pin 14 | |
| Pan servo (servo2) | `GPIO19` (Pin 35) / Pin 4 (5V) / Pin 39 | |
| Toggle switch | `GPIO17` (Pin 11) / Pin 17 (3.3V) / Pin 25 | 3‑pin module |
| DHT22 (optional) | `GPIO4` (Pin 7) / Pin 1 (3.3V) / Pin 9 | |
| Cooling fan | Pin 4 (5V, split with pan) / Pin 6 | |

Servos and fan draw from the Pi 5V rail with shared ground. The mount is inverted, so select **Rotate 180°** in the web UI's ⚙ Camera Controls; the choice persists across service restarts and reboots. See `PIN_DIAGRAM.md` for the full pinout.

> **Camera note:** the sensor reports as a plain `ov5647` regardless of the lens/filter, so software can't tell it's the NoIR wide-angle module — the NoIR behaviour is configured, not auto-detected. See [Camera capabilities](#camera-capabilities) for the tuning, day/night and image config.

**Switch** (`ky004-control.py`): `SWITCH_MODE=auto` probes `GPIO17` at startup. A floating pin means no switch is attached, so the camera is kept on and restarted if it stops. A connected switch keeps the existing behavior: ON (`GPIO17` low) starts `dog-stream` (and `cloudflared-tunnel` if enabled); OFF stops them cleanly. Use `SWITCH_MODE=gpio` to force hardware control or `SWITCH_MODE=always-on` to bypass GPIO explicitly. Set `SWITCH_ON_VALUE=1` if your module is inverted, or `SWITCH_PIN` for a different GPIO.

## Controls

- Desktop: arrow buttons, `↑ ↓ ← →`, or `W A S D`
- Mobile: tap/hold above/below center (tilt) or left/right (pan)

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` on the Pi (never commit it). The most relevant settings:

```env
SECRET_KEY=replace_me
MAX_VIEWERS=3
PORT=5000
STREAM_MAX_FPS=15          # framerate cap; lower = less power draw (see Power & stability)
STREAM_WIDTH=1296          # stream resolution (default 1296x972, was 640x480)
STREAM_HEIGHT=972          #   1080p works but VGA/960p are gentler on the 5V rail
DOG_NAME=Kotaro
DOGCAM_CAMERA_VIEW=normal  # initial fallback; the saved gear-menu choice wins
CAMERA_VIEW_STATE_FILE=/var/lib/dogcam/camera-view.json
# --- NoIR wide-angle camera: colour tuning + day/night ---
CAM_TUNING_FILE=ov5647_noir.json  # NoIR tuning kills the daylight magenta cast; "" = sensor default
CAM_SHARPNESS=1.5          # ISP tuning (0-16); also CAM_CONTRAST/CAM_SATURATION/CAM_BRIGHTNESS/CAM_EV
CAM_NOISE_REDUCTION=fast   # off|fast|high_quality|minimal|zsl
CAM_SAT_BRIGHT=1.0         # saturation in real daylight (>= CAM_BRIGHT_LUX)
CAM_SAT_DIM=0.7            # saturation at the day/night edge (artificial light = IR false colour)
CAM_BRIGHT_LUX=400         # lux considered real daylight
NIGHT_MAX_FPS=6            # night mode lowers fps so exposure can lengthen (real sensitivity)
CAM_NIGHT_EV_MAX=1.0       # EV bias at total darkness (scaled to 0 at DAYNIGHT_NIGHT_LUX)
DAYNIGHT_AUTO=1            # auto colour(day)/grayscale(night) off the camera Lux meter
DAYNIGHT_NIGHT_LUX=5       # below this (sustained DAYNIGHT_NIGHT_AFTER=45s) -> night
DAYNIGHT_DAY_LUX=12        # above this (sustained DAYNIGHT_DAY_AFTER=8s) -> day; eager to show colour
DAYNIGHT_MODE=auto         # startup override: auto|day|night
CAM_ZOOM=1.0               # digital zoom 1.0-CAM_ZOOM_MAX(4.0) via ScalerCrop
SWITCH_MODE=auto            # auto|gpio|always-on
SWITCH_PIN=17
SWITCH_ON_VALUE=0
TEMP_SOURCE=sensor         # or ha
ENABLE_CLOUDFLARED=1       # 0 when a reverse proxy owns the domain
```

See `.env.example` for the full list (servo tuning, Home Assistant, Cloudflare, proxy‑trust flags).

**Reverse‑proxy mode** — when another host (e.g. a Mac mini running Traefik/Authelia/Cloudflare) owns the public domain and proxies to the Pi: set `ENABLE_CLOUDFLARED=0`, `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=1`, and (behind Authelia) `TRUST_PROXY_AUTH_HEADERS=1` so a `Remote-User` header is trusted. Configure the proxy-only navigation links with `DOGCAM_HOME_URL=https://portal.example/` and `DOGCAM_LOGOUT_URL=https://auth.example/logout`; they are rendered only for trusted proxy-authenticated requests, while a local login keeps only its local Logout action. Camera controls are limited to users in `DOGCAM_CONTROL_GROUPS`; others can view only. Keep all `TRUST_PROXY_*` at `0` in standalone mode.

**Temperature source** — `/temp` reads a local DHT22 (`TEMP_SOURCE=sensor`, needs `adafruit_dht`, wired to `GPIO4`) or Home Assistant (`TEMP_SOURCE=ha` + `HA_URL`/`HA_TOKEN`/`HA_*_ENTITY` using an HA long‑lived token). HA mode skips the DHT22 dependency.

## Camera capabilities

The sensor is an **OV5647 behind a wide‑angle NoIR (no IR‑cut filter) lens**. NoIR sees in the dark under IR light, but has two quirks this app handles:

- **Daytime magenta cast.** With no IR‑cut filter, IR leaks into the red/blue channels and standard `ov5647.json` can't correct it (AWB alone leaves it purple). `CAM_TUNING_FILE=ov5647_noir.json` loads the NoIR colour‑correction matrix and neutralises it. *The tuned `Picamera2` must be constructed before any other camera‑manager call — `global_camera_info()` first silently pins the default tuning.*
- **Automatic day/night.** `DAYNIGHT_AUTO=1` runs **colour by day, grayscale by night** (colour is pure noise under IR in the dark), switched off the camera's own AE **Lux** meter — no extra hardware. Two thresholds (`DAYNIGHT_NIGHT_LUX` / `DAYNIGHT_DAY_LUX`) with per‑direction sustain times give hysteresis; recovery to day is eager and descent to night is lazy, so a lit room always shows colour.
- **Light‑adaptive tuning.** Under artificial light IR reflects unevenly (green ceiling, magenta fabric) — no white balance fixes it and saturation only amplifies it. So saturation scales with lux (`CAM_SAT_DIM` at the day edge → `CAM_SAT_BRIGHT` in real daylight). Night mode drops to `NIGHT_MAX_FPS` so exposure can lengthen (real light gathering, less power) and adds an EV bias that scales with darkness (a fixed boost blows out a lit room).

All image tuning (`CAM_*`), day/night switching and digital zoom are **ISP‑side `set_controls()` — no pipeline restart and no measurable extra power** (bench‑tested: identical `vcgencmd get_throttled` at VGA vs 1296×972 vs 1080p under a live viewer; the `STREAM_MAX_FPS` cap, not pixel count, bounds the draw). Endpoints (control actions need `DOGCAM_CONTROL_GROUPS`; GETs are view‑only):

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/camera/info` | GET | active resolution, fps cap, orientation, zoom, tuning, day/night mode + lux |
| `/camera/view` | GET / POST | read / set persisted orientation `{"view":"normal\|upside_down"}`; changes restart the camera pipeline |
| `/camera/daynight` | GET / POST | read status / set override `{"mode":"auto\|day\|night"}` |
| `/camera/zoom` | GET / POST | read / set digital zoom `{"zoom":2.0}` or `{"step":0.5}` |
| `/snapshot` | GET | latest frame as a still JPEG (serves the live frame — no extra capture) |

**In the web UI**, the ⚙ settings button opens Camera Controls. The **Camera orientation** row switches between **Normal** and **Rotate 180°**, restarts the camera pipeline to apply the transform, and persists the choice across service restarts and reboots. The **Day / Night** row provides **🔄 Auto** (follow the light sensor, the default), **☀️ Light** (force colour), and **🌙 Dark** (force grayscale). Camera-control permission (`DOGCAM_CONTROL_GROUPS`) is required to change either setting; everyone else sees them read-only.

### Camera configuration reference

Every knob is an env var in `.env` with a safe default — nothing below is required, and unset values keep the sensor/ISP default. Change them without touching code; a restart applies resolution/tuning-file changes, while day/night, saturation, zoom and EV adjust live. The **Default** column is the value shipped in `.env.example` (a few internal code fallbacks differ slightly).

**Resolution & tuning**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `STREAM_WIDTH` × `STREAM_HEIGHT` | `1296` × `972` | Stream resolution. 640×480 / 800×600 are lighter; 1920×1080 works. Pixel count barely affects the 5V rail at a fixed fps. |
| `STREAM_MAX_FPS` | `15` | Framerate cap — the real power lever (higher = more brown-out risk). |
| `CAM_TUNING_FILE` | `ov5647_noir.json` | libcamera tuning file. NoIR file removes the daylight magenta cast; set empty (`CAM_TUNING_FILE=`) for the sensor default. |
| `DOGCAM_CAMERA_VIEW` | `normal` | Initial `normal` or `upside_down` fallback before a UI choice is saved. |
| `CAMERA_VIEW_STATE_FILE` | `/var/lib/dogcam/camera-view.json` | Persistent orientation selected from Camera Controls; takes precedence over `DOGCAM_CAMERA_VIEW`. |

**Image quality (ISP, ~no power cost)**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CAM_SHARPNESS` | `1.5` | 0–16 (1.0 = neutral). |
| `CAM_CONTRAST` | unset | 0–32 (1.0 = neutral). |
| `CAM_SATURATION` | unset | 0–32. If set, becomes the daylight anchor for the lux-adaptive curve; leave unset to use `CAM_SAT_BRIGHT`/`CAM_SAT_DIM`. |
| `CAM_BRIGHTNESS` | unset | −1.0 to 1.0. |
| `CAM_EV` | unset | Exposure bias, −8.0 to 8.0 (day mode). |
| `CAM_AWB_MODE` | unset (auto) | `auto`/`incandescent`/`tungsten`/`fluorescent`/`indoor`/`daylight`/`cloudy`/`custom`. |
| `CAM_NOISE_REDUCTION` | `fast` | `off`/`fast`/`high_quality`/`minimal`/`zsl`. |

**Automatic day/night (NoIR)**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DAYNIGHT_AUTO` | `1` | Enable auto colour(day)/grayscale(night) off the Lux meter. |
| `DAYNIGHT_NIGHT_LUX` | `5` | Below this (sustained) → night. |
| `DAYNIGHT_DAY_LUX` | `12` | Above this (sustained) → day. Must be > night; low so any real light shows colour. |
| `DAYNIGHT_NIGHT_AFTER` | `45` | Seconds below `NIGHT_LUX` before going grayscale (lazy). |
| `DAYNIGHT_DAY_AFTER` | `8` | Seconds above `DAY_LUX` before going colour (eager — never stuck grey in a lit room). |
| `DAYNIGHT_CHECK_INTERVAL` | `10` | Seconds between Lux checks. |
| `DAYNIGHT_MODE` | `auto` | Startup / manual override: `auto`/`day`/`night`. |

**Light-adaptive tuning**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CAM_SAT_BRIGHT` | `1.0` | Saturation in real daylight (≥ `CAM_BRIGHT_LUX`). |
| `CAM_SAT_DIM` | `0.7` | Saturation at the day/night edge — damped so artificial-light IR false colour isn't amplified. |
| `CAM_BRIGHT_LUX` | `400` | Lux treated as real daylight (top of the saturation ramp). |
| `NIGHT_MAX_FPS` | `6` | Night fps cap: lower = longer exposure = real sensitivity, less power. |
| `CAM_NIGHT_EV_MAX` | `1.0` | EV brightness lift at total darkness, scaled to 0 at `NIGHT_LUX` (a fixed lift blows out a lit room). |

**Digital zoom**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CAM_ZOOM` | `1.0` | Startup zoom (1.0 = full field of view). |
| `CAM_ZOOM_MAX` | `4.0` | Max zoom the `/camera/zoom` endpoint allows. |

Tests: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_camera_features` (runs off‑Pi with stubbed camera libs).

## Raspberry Pi setup

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y libgpiod2 libcamera-apps-lite python3-picamera2 python3-dev
# DHT22 only: sudo apt install -y libgpiod-dev
git clone <your-repo-url> dogo-cam && cd dogo-cam
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh      # ensure ~/.local/bin is on PATH
uv sync
uv run gunicorn --worker-class gthread --workers 1 --threads 6 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 dogcam_stream:app
```

Then open `http://<pi-ip>:5000`.

## systemd

Example units are in `service_startup/`. Copy `dog-stream-flask.service` → `/etc/systemd/system/dog-stream.service`, adjust `User` / `WorkingDirectory` / `EnvironmentFile` / `ExecStart`, then:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now dog-stream
```

Install `button-control.service` in all configurations: it uses `SWITCH_MODE=auto` to detect a connected switch and otherwise keeps the camera online. Use `SWITCH_MODE=always-on` for a deterministic switchless installation. Also install `dogcam-watchdog.{service,timer}` for stream self-healing, and optionally `cloudflared-tunnel.service` for standalone tunnel mode (after creating the tunnel + `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` and setting `ENABLE_CLOUDFLARED=1`).

## Deploying updates

**Manual:**

```bash
cd ~/dogo-cam && git pull && uv sync && sudo systemctl restart dog-stream
```

**Push to deploy (CI):** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on a **self‑hosted runner** (on an always‑on box you trust, e.g. the mini). On every push to `main` (or manual `workflow_dispatch`) it SSHes to the Pi and runs a fixed deploy script — the runner's *outbound* connection means the Pi can stay behind NAT with no inbound webhook. Because this is a **public repo**, it's locked down (see below): the runner uses a command‑locked SSH key that can only run `deploy/dogcam-deploy.sh`. Install the artifacts:

```bash
sudo install -m0755 deploy/dogcam-deploy.sh /usr/local/bin/dogcam-deploy.sh
sudo install -m0440 deploy/dogcam-deploy.sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/dogcam-deploy
# then add the forced-command line (see dogcam-deploy.sh header) for the deploy key to authorized_keys
```

Existing installations must reinstall both files after updating the repository; the checked-out copies do not replace `/usr/local/bin/dogcam-deploy.sh` or `/etc/sudoers.d/dogcam-deploy` automatically.

## Power & stability

A Pi 3B funnels all current through its micro‑USB / polyfuse (~2–2.5A), so camera + MJPEG encoding + servos can brown out the 5V rail (under‑voltage) even with a strong supply — the camera stalls or the app hangs.

- **`STREAM_MAX_FPS`** (default 15) caps the framerate to cut peak draw — the biggest lever (`vcgencmd get_throttled` non‑zero = dips).
- Single‑shot autofocus at startup (imx708) avoids continuous AF‑motor draw and PDAF log spam.
- Real fix: power the servos from a **separate 5V** (common ground), or use a Pi 4/5.
- **Self‑healing (three layers):**
  1. `/video_feed` gives up after `STREAM_FRAME_TIMEOUT` (5s) without a frame. Gunicorn also reserves request capacity beyond `MAX_VIEWERS`, so healthy long-lived MJPEG streams cannot starve servo controls or health checks. The page reconnects the `<img>` automatically and shows *🟡 Stream Stalled* meanwhile.
  2. If no frames arrive for `STREAM_STALL_RESTART_AFTER` (20s) the app tears down and re‑creates the Picamera2 pipeline in‑process — no service restart, the UI stays up.
  3. `dogcam-watchdog.timer` restarts the *service* only if the app is dead, or if `/stream_health` stays 503 past `STALL_ESCALATE_SECONDS` (120s). `dog-stream.service` uses `TimeoutStopSec=15` + `KillMode=mixed` so a stuck camera cleanup can't wedge it in `deactivating`.
- `GET /stream_health` → `{"healthy", "frames", "last_frame_age_s", ...}` (200/503) for dashboards and external monitors.
- Blank feed but `camera_status` says available → reseat the **CSI ribbon** (a loose cable gives "Camera frontend timed out" / zero frames while the sensor still enumerates on I²C). Check `journalctl -u dog-stream | grep -i "Restarting camera"` to see how often the pipeline is stalling.
- Tests: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_stream_stall` runs the app off‑Pi with stubbed camera libs and reproduces the thread‑exhaustion bug.

## Security hardening

Important for a public repo with a self‑hosted runner:

- SSH key‑only (`PasswordAuthentication no`, `PermitRootLogin no`); minimal `authorized_keys` (admin + command‑locked deploy key).
- Firewall `:5000` to the proxy/tunnel host + localhost; drop the rest.
- Disable unused services (e.g. Samba on `139/445`) — keep the surface to `:22` + `:5000`.
- Scoped deploy sudo (`deploy/dogcam-deploy.sudoers`, restart only); avoid `NOPASSWD: ALL` on the service user.

## Notes

- `.env` stays only on the Pi / your local machine.
- Servo positions persist in `/tmp/servo_positions.json`; tune with `SERVO_STEP_SIZE` / `SERVO_SETTLE_SECONDS`.
